# Introduction
This Git Repository corresponds to a groupwork project for the course Software Engineering and Programming II (Java). We were tasked with conceiving, developing and programming a programme in java.

Starting on the project just before Halloween, we decided to produce a game, which we called *Witch Dash*. The aim of the game is to avoid pumpkins which fly towards the witch character, controlled by the player using the keyboard. If the witch collides with three pumpkins, the game is over. We implementated the game using java and java FX.

# Aims
The aim of the project was to apply what we have learned in our software engineering and programming II classes, using java, java FX, Git, and Jira. We wanted the end product to be a simple game, which would be fun to play.

# Context

We had three weeks for the project. Playing the game should be easy and fun, and it should have an attractive design. All team members should work equally on the project. 


# Installation instructions
  1. Download all files from this github repository.
  2. Unzip and save the files to a folder of your choice.
  3. Copy the path of the desired version file (.jar) to the clipboard.
  4. Open your computer's console or terminal
  5. There, enter java -jar followed by the copied path (.jar).

# Player controls

Once the game has started, you can move your witch character up and down using the W and S keys on your keyboard. Pumpkins will come from the right, move to stay out of their way. If you loose all of your lives, you'll have to start again.

# User Stories

| US | Description | Acceptance criteria | Priority | Story Points |
|----|----|----|----|----|
| 1 | As a user I control the upwards and downwards movement of the witch character with the keyboard. | The program should recognise keyboard inputs and move the character accordingly. | high | 5 |
| 2 | As a user, I expect that the obstacles fly towards the witch character at alternating heights. | With the help of a random function, the objects appear at different heights. | high | 5 |
| 3 | As a user, I would like to have a main menu so that I can start the game. | A main menu with start and exit button shall be available to the player. | high | 10 |
| 4 | As a user, I would like to be shown as soon as I have won the game. | If the player wins, a new window shall open. | medium | 10 |
| 5 | As a user, I would like to be able to choose between different levels of game difficulty. | The level of difficulty can be selected in the main menu before beginning a game. More objects appear at higher levels. | medium | 10 |
| 6 | As a user I would like to be able to win. | A functioning game should be programmed that is not impossible to play. | high | 10 |
| 7 | As a programmer, I want to be able to easily understand the programme so that I can rebuild it, maintain it and add new features. | Comments, logical structure. | high | 5 |
